### Audio fix for 4 speakers
* Make a new aggregate device on MIDI Setup app which will contain both available output devices (Tweeter & B&O Bass speakers)
* Go to Sound Preferences and select that new aggregate device for main audio output
* In order to be able to adjust the volume for that new aggregate audio device, please make use of: <a href="https://github.com/rlxone/MultiSoundChanger/releases">MultiSoundChanger</a>

### Bonus
* Wifi & Bluetooth work, but with experimental driver and HeliPort app (expect some problems)
* ICC Profile that improves the screen's native color
